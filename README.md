# TicTacToe

An offline Tic Tac Toe Mobile game created to study multiple ways of state Management on Flutter. At first, it was created using only useState and Stateful Widgets. Then I replaced it by a BLoC/Cubit approach to this final version.

## How to run

I've built this with Flutter Channel stable, 3.10.2. So I really don't know how it will behave when you follow the steps in other versions. Considering this, here are the steps:

- Clone this repository
- Run the command: `flutter pub get` on its directory
- Then run it using your favorite device.

To run the tests, you can just do the following command:

- Integration test: `flutter test integration_test/game_test.dart`
- Widget test: `flutter test test/widget_test.dart`
